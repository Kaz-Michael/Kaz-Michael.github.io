I'm an amateur photographer and especially enjoy exploring city landscapes and the relationship between nature and modernity.

# Sylvia Plath
I'm an incredibly passionate fan of Sylvia Plath's work, and am currently reading her Collected Poems which contain all of her poetry from 1956 up until her death as well as selected poems from her Juvenilia. I enjoy analysing and exploring all poetry, but especially Plath who has many recurring themes, with her changing passions and interests reflected in motifs and conceits in her work.

My favourite of Plath's work is 'Elm' and 'The Moon and the Yew Tree'. I love the exploration of nature and i find the lines incredibly moving, especialy "I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets" and "I simply cannot see where there is to get to." Although Plath's work is oftentimes very depressing and emotional, I also find her incredibly hopeful and uplifting, seeing how she found solice in the beauty of the world and in writing poetry.
