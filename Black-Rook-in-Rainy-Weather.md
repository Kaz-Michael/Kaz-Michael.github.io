# Black Rook in Rainy Weather

This poem is one of my favourites of Plath. A beautiful optimistic exploration of finding beauty and contentment in the everyday, alongside explorations of the extraordinary and supernatural create a hopeful poem filled with binary oppositions. Plath compares and contrasts the two ideas not as she usually does with violence and negativity but with peaceful joy.

Plath's use of religious imagery here is, unlike much of her work, not disparaging or hateful but rather a genuine reflection of the human desire for greatness and to be loved. The frequent mention of "angels" in this poem creates an ethereal understone, contrasted with the thematic motif of the "rook". The juxtaposing ordinary and extraordinary could create conflict and violence however here no such violent imagery occurs. Plath hopes for the extraordinary, longing for a sense of sels-importance, for the "fire" of passion and inspiration, however equally she acknowledges the need to "patch together a content". In this way Plath's longing is no longerone of violence of self-hatred but simply a calm musing in her day-to-day life.

I also love the circularity of this poem, with the opening stanza exploring how Plath does not expect any "miracle" or "accident" to save her from the mundane and then the final stanza exploring the idea of these "miracles" not as the extraordinary of the celestial but as "tricks of radiance" - miracles are finding beauty in the mundane, making poetry of nature and the world around you, and finding contentment and self-worth within that world.

The poem ends on a contrastingly optimistic and pessimistic tone. Whilst the "slow random descent" might connote negativity, of her falling from grace (like the angels she mentions throughout) or an emotional and mental descent, for me this creates a sense of optimism. Plath comes to terms with the ordinarity of her world and through this comes to expect the "descent" hopefully as something extraordinary.
