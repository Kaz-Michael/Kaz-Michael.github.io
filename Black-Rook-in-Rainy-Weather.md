# Black Rook in Rainy Weather

This poem is one of my favourites of Plath. A beautiful optimistic exploration of finding beauty and contentment in the everyday, alongside explorations of the extraordinary and supernatural create a hopeful poem filled with binary oppositions. Plath compares and contrasts the two ideas not as she usually does with violence and negativity but with peaceful joy.
