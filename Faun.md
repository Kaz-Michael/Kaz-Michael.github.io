# Faun
*Faun* begins as (as the name might suggest) a story of a faun but then it is revealed that this faun is actually a man. Just as the reader thinks they understand who he is, he (re)transforms into a faun. This creates a sense of circularity to the poem, and explores a sense of teh entanglement between internal nature and reality, and the duality of humanity and nature. This narrative of confusion doesn't appear to have a sense of internal distress on Plath's part but is instead an exploration of the magical and unusual, and the complexity of identity. 

Throughout the poem however, no matter what state the 'man' is in, he is an outsider. He might call to the owls and they come to see him but they do so for him as an outsider. Eve when finally transofmred in teh final stanza, he is still above the other creates around him as a 'god' (note this word, however, is not capitalised). In this way, the 'man' is not fully man (not so much as given a name) but equally is not fully animal. He is ina state of in-between.

As noted, Plth chooses not to capitalise 'god'. Perhaps this is a rejection of traditional approaches to religion and the concept of deities. More so, this is a futher complication of the faun's identity, that he is not a true God but a false deity, or at the very elast a god of limited power, underserving of a capitalised title.
