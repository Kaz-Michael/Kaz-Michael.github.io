# Sylvia Plath
---
I'm an incredibly passionate fan of Sylvia Plath's work and I'm currently reading her Collected Poems, which contan all of her poetry from 1956 up until her death as well as selected poems from her Juvenilia. I enjoy analysing and exploring all poetry, but especially Plath who has many recurring themes, with her changing passions and interests reflected in motifs and conceits in her work.

My favourite of Plath's work is *Elm* and *The Moon and the Yew Tree*. I love the exploration of nature and I find the lines incredibly moving, especially "I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets" and "I simply cannot see where there is to get to". Although Plath's work is oftentimes very depressing and emotional, I also find her incredibly hopeful and uplifting, seeing how she found solice in the beauty of the world and in writing poetry. 

## Collected Poems - 1956


### Key Themes
Although I've yet to finish the 1956 collection of Plath's poems, I have so far noticed many recurring themes in her work as well as spotting her emerging style and her earlier experimentation which will eventually lead to her final collection Ariel.

**Birds:**

Plath uses birds in many interesting ways in poems such as *Conversation Among the Ruins* where she mentions both "rooks croak" and "peacocks". The repetition of rooks is especially notable as they are often used in a way to explore isolation and companionship. In *Conversation Among the Ruins* Rooks are presented as a unified chorus, seperated from the speaker who is in a state of turmoil. In *Winter Landscape* Plath compares herself to a Rook, in isolation. Even later, in *Prospect* Plath describes "two black rooks". In this way therefore Rooks are presented in various stages of companionship, but are also often ominous signs of turmoil and "havoc". 

Plath also mentions other birds such as "peacocks", using these as signs of masculinity and frivolity, although not neccesarily in a disparaging way. Plath uses Peacocks and other birds as a way of creating a lexical field of colour, contrasting vibrant birds with grey crows and rooks, as a way of connoting tone and creating atmosphere. Often Plath's mood when writing these poems is reflected in her choice of bird as a reference. 

**The Moon:**

Plath is possibly most well known for her frequent reference to the moon. Throughout her work she refers to the moon as a friend, as a careless or even cruel 'other', and even as a symbol of her mother. In the 1956 poems it is notable that the moon is referred to in a positive light, although equally as something seperate and "celestial", distant from Plath no matter how much she might admire the moon. Plath wields the imagery of the moon to create incredible nighttime scenes and an overall tone of piece and awe.

**Water:**

Plath explores water imagery in a much more diverse way than any other motifs in her work. With poems dedicated to the ocean as a violent and powerful force at one end, and at the other a simple "black pond". In *Tale of a Tub* Plath's water imagery is not that of nature but that of a bathroom, using the lifeless surroundings to reflect an internal loss of certainty and meaning. My personal favourite is the first stanza of *Letter to a Purist*:

"The envious assults of sea

(Essaying, wave by wave,

Tide by tide,

To undo him, perpetually),"

These lines portay the sea both as powerful but predictable and aimless; as violent but soothing (with the alliteration in "essaying"); as something admirable but equally something powerless in comparison to the "Purist" subject of the poem. The use of sibilance and dental alliteration create a smooth series of phrases, reflecting the methodical sway of the ocean. Unlike much of Plath's later work, the stanzas in 1956 are often much longer, however I love the use of very short lines and phrases which she continues to use for much of her poetry. Furthermore, the use of rhyme in the poem continues to create a sense of routine and predictability much like the tide of the sea.
