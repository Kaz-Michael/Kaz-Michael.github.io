# Photography
I'm an amateur photographer and especially enjoy exploring city landscapes and the relationship between nature and modernity.

I took this photo on my way back from Ashton Court. Many of the views were amazing but I especially enjoyed editing this photo to make the colours more vibrant and reduce the glare from the sun's reflections. I like the merging of nature, society and youth culture in the scene.
