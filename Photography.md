# Photography
I'm an amateur photographer and especially enjoy exploring city landscapes and the relationship between nature and modernity.

I took this photo on my way back from Ashton Court. Many of the views were amazing but I especially enjoyed editing this photo to make the colours more vibrant and reduce the glare from the sun's reflections. I like the merging of nature, society and youth culture in the scene.

I also took this photo on the same journey home from Ashton Court. I love the sharp lines of the building and the bright colours of the graffiti, and I chose to shoot with the camera portrait instead of landscape.
