# Elm

Written as the dramatic monologue of a tree, mediated through the voice of Plath, Elm as an unusual presence of violence and restlessness. Throughout the poem there is a continuing battle for agency and dominance. At first Plath/the narrator is dominated by Elm and by its emotions and knowledge. The use of simple declaritive statements where the Elm dictates its knowledge and also decides what we as the reader know and feel - "It is what you fear." However, as the poem goes on these declaritives descend into "I must", self imperatives, with a sense of obligation, as well as questions and repetitions. The sudden lack of knowledge in the Elm juxtaposes her previosly perceived wisdom. In the poem therefore it becomes imcreasingly difficult to discern a protagonist, creating a broad oscillating alignment as we try to find who in the poem has agency.

Elms themselves are associated with rebirth and revival (but in order for rebirth and resurrection there must first be death or a sacrifice). They are also associated as trees with great knowledge and wisdom, having been here on earth for centuries before humanity and the individual speaker/reader. As with much of Plath's poetry, she personifies the Elm as a woman of immense knowledge and power (which she also does with the Moon later on in the poem).
